#watchout
A game implemented with D3 in which shuriken enemies are randomly flying across the screen and player needs to avoid getting hit. The player (represented as flying saucer) moves around the galaxy through use of the arrow keys. When hit, an explosion occurs. The scoreboard is updated as throughout the game.
